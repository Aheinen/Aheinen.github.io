title:  Bringing My Blog to the 21st Century

Due to the decreased workload this week, I was able to finally bring my blog into the 21st century. The first implementation of my blog was hard coded in HTML & CSS. While this was a great learning experience, I wasn't that interested in tweaking CSS all day until I had something that was absolutely perfect.

My new website utilizes Jekyll, which can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a framework that allows you to get a clean, good-looking site up and running quickly. I can now easily write blog posts in markdown and not have to worry about making sure my headers and footers are correctly pasted in each post. I'm hoping that the fact that it is very easy to get posts up and running now will keep me motivated to blog throughout the entirety of DBC. I was able to set up Jekyll and transfer over all my previous blog posts in just a matter of a couple of hours.

Overall I am fairly happy with the result, however I would like to look into implementing Bootstrap over the coming weeks.
