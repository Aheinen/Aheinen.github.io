While there aren't necessarily dumb questions, it's generally a good idea to do your own research before asking a question. People are more likely to answer difficult questions that couldn't be solved in a quick Google search. In a workplace environment where everyone is busy with their own issues, it is a good rule of thumb to spend a chunk of time trying to figure something out on your own before asking someone.

If you have spent some time wracking your brain about how to solve an issue and still can't figure it out, there are a few things to keep in mind when you ask someone a question. These were written from the viewpoint of asking your co-workers in a workplace setting, but the same rules apply to asking questions online.

1. Make sure you are asking the correct audiance. Don't ask your HR representative why you can't iterate through a string.
2. Make sure the person you are asking isn't slammed with other work. People are less likely to take the time to give you a good answer if they have too many things on their plate already.
3. Be brief. I can't stress this enough. People are busy. If it takes you five minutes to get to your point, they stopped listening four and half minutes ago. Summarize your question in a few key points to make sure they don't lose interest.
4. Plan it out. Don't just say the first thing that pops into your head. Plan out your question so that it makes sense!
5. Write it down. OK, so this doesn't exactly pertain to asking the question, but make sure to take note of what the answer is. Don't make the person have to repeat themselves if the question pops up again a few weeks later.

The morale of the story is that you should always put some thought into your question before just blurting it out. Think about who you should ask, think about how your question should be structured and most importantly, write down what the person says! No one likes to repeat themselves.

Now, any questions?
