  <article class="post-content">
    <p>According to the personal thinking style quiz, my Gregorc Thinking Style heavily favors “Abstract Random” with scores in the remaining three categories about equal to each other. My first thought when I saw the result was, “Random is probably an understatement”. For instance, while writing blog posts, I find myself stopping mid sentence to write the conclusion that just popped into my head. As a matter of fact, BRB… In all seriousness, I dug a little deeper to find out what Abstract Random really meant.</p>

<p>The TL;DR on Abstract Random thinkers is as follows: They like broad guidelines and tasks that involve a group of people that all get along and know each other on a personal level. They don’t like feeling restricted, competing with others or working with people that aren’t nice. I would say that is pretty spot on for me and part of the reason I am leaving my current job/field (zing!).</p>

<p>Equipped with this knowledge, I will attempt to put myself in the most conducive learning environments by trying to get to know everyone in my cohort on a personal level (even though it is hard for me sometimes). I do feel that I am less likely to participate when I don’t know everyone around me, but become the one that won’t shut up after getting comfortable. The introduction and fears emails have definitely been a step in the right direction already!</p>

<p>I don’t think my struggles at DBC so far have been related to my thinking style. My biggest struggle with DBC so far has been the amount of hours required to finish the weekly tasks. I am currently working ~50-55 hours a week and am having to get all of my DBC stuff done on weeknights after work and weekends. I am definitely looking forward to Phase 1 as I will be able to turn my full attention to DBC. I think that work is a bit mentally draining for me currently as I always find that I think and learn better in the morning/afternoon than I do at night.</p>

<p>My mindset has always had both fixed and growth elements. I’m typically a persistent person that believes anyone can achieve anything with hard work. I take criticism well and find other people’s stories about success very inspiring. That said, I sometimes find myself avoiding challenges due to the fear of failure. I think that attempting more difficult (or nearly impossible) tasks over time could help me understand that there is no problem with failing a challenge. It is more important important to learn something from a challenge than it is to successfully complete it. I think taking bigger challenges more often (and inevitably failing more) could help swing this fixed portion of my thought process more toward the growth perspective.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks I will focus my attention toward getting to know my cohort and taking on more challenges!</p>
