  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In Claude M. Steele’s article written for the Atlantic Magazine in 1999, he defines stereotype threat as “The threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype, or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype.” The anxiety about being judged can cause students to perform more poorly on educational exams than they otherwise would have if it were not for the stereotype threat. In his research, he found that the mere wording a proctor gives before an exam can cause students to fall victim to this threat. This is crazy to think about. These stereotypes can build so subtly over time that we don’t even know we are nervous about inadvertently confirming them!</p>

<p>While not many negative stereotypes come with being a white male from a middle class family, I can say that I have felt the affect of stereotype threat a time or two. The memory that sticks out the most to me would be when I thought I wanted to go to law school and was preparing to take the LSAT my junior and senior year of college. I had high hopes of attending a top 13 law school and in order to do so, I needed to score well on the LSAT. I worked my butt off preparing for that test, but couldn’t help but think that I wasn’t doing enough. I mean, I was attending the University of Iowa, which isn’t exactly on the same level as Harvard, Stanford or Yale. I let myself believe that schools would judge me negatively as I was attending a ‘lesser’ university than other candidates. I was proud of the solid GPA I had garnered at Iowa, until I saw that it was no better than other students at far superior programs. How could I possibly compete with these other candidates?</p>

<p>When test day finally came, it went by in a blur. Needless to say, I panicked and let other people get inside my head. I was afraid of living up to what everyone expected I was, just a midwestern kid with no real wits. I scored far lower than I had in any of my recent practice exams. I was crushed when I received my score because I knew I could do better. But my story didn’t stop there, I wanted to take it again. I took some time off before hitting the books again and got a chance to recharge my batteries a bit. Once I restarted, I was scoring better on the practice tests than I ever had. I no longer cared about playing into the stereotype, I had already done that. What was the worst that could happen now? I was able to keep this attitude throughout my studying leading up to the exam and my score improved tremendously.</p>

<p>Stereotypes are a real detriment to society. As long as there are negative stereotypes that people are afraid of inadvertently confirming, there will be stereotype threat in our society. I wish there was an easier solution to be had, but there isn’t. We need to continue to actively campaign against the use of these stereotypes and be individually aware about how our actions reinforce stereotypes in ourselves and in others.</p>
