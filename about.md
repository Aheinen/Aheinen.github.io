Even though I live on the West Coast now, I am a Mid-West boy through and through. I was born in Aurora, IL (about 45 minutes west of Chicago). I went to school at the University of Iowa where I majored in Economics. Upon graduation, I got a job in Equity Research out in Portland, OR. After working as a research associate for almost three years, I have decided to take the leap to become a developer. I am currently enrolled in Dev Bootcamp and start my on-site training on April 27th!
