  <h2>Whatchu' Thinking 'Bout DBC?</h2>

      “Successful people are comfortable being put in uncomfortable situations.”
    </p>
    <p>
        No, that quote isn’t from me. I’m not real sure who the first person to say it was either, but it is a quote that I think is relevant to all DBC students. In Shereef’s Fireside Chat, he explained how DBC came about. He wanted to help a friend become a developer in just three months (easy right?…). He posted about it on Hacker News and hundreds of people flooded his inbox asking to join. Think about that. Hundreds of people literally jumped at the chance to quit their jobs and move across the country to be taught how to code by some guy they didn’t even know. The process wasn’t even proven at this point. Those people’s loved ones must have thought they were insane! But that is the stuff that makes DBC special.

        DBC gives you the opportunity to take control of your life, at the price of being uncomfortable. You are dropping everything that used to define you to become a developer. It won’t be easy and DBC is upfront about that. It would have been easy to have kept going down the road I was heading and no one would have faulted me for that. I have a good job in equity research, live in a really cool city and have amazing friends. I could have taken the CFA and set myself up for a promotion, but I knew deep down that wasn’t what I wanted. I’m nervous about this change, but I’m confident that DBC will put me on the right track toward accomplishing my dream.

        So I guess what I am trying to say is this: While all DBC students come from diverse backgrounds, what holds us all together is the fact that each one of us is comfortable with the prospect of being put in uncomfortable situations. When you put a bunch of people like that into one classroom, amazing things are bound to happen. I am so excited to be a part of this life changing experience and truly cannot wait to see what kind of solutions we can come up with together.
