      As far as we’ve come in the battle for equal opportunity, it is hard to believe that there is still such a huge gap that needs to be closed. Of the major social media tech companies in the United States, not one has a workforce made up of more than 40% women. What’s even worse, there are only 3 female tech CEOs in the Fortune 500. But if you think it is bad now, the future could be even worse. Just 18% of computer science graduates in 2012 were female, that’s down from 37% in 1985. How will we make up the gap if the pool of potential female developers continues to shrink?

        It isn’t just the employee level where women are underrepresented though, just 4% of senior venture capitalists and 19% of angel investors are women. So, the people who are calling the shots are even less diverse than the companies they are funding. It just seems like a downward spiral waiting to happen.

  <p class="par_text">
        This isn’t just bad for women, this is bad for everyone. A less diverse work force means fewer points of view, fewer people to contest what end up being bad ideas and fewer chances to push the world forward with truly innovative ideas. You need people with different backgrounds and view points if you want to stay on the cutting edge.

        So, what do we need to do to combat this? I wish I could tell you. One thing I can suggest is to keep talking about it. The lack of gender diversity is a real issue and it isn’t just going to go away on its own. We have to not only increase awareness, but motivate people to act. I certainly don’t know what the solution will be, but I definitely want to be part of the conversation. I am ready to engage.
