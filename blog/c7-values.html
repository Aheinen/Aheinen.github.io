  <div id="title">What Values are Important to You?</div>
  <section>
  <p class="par_text">
      I typically find myself to be the happiest, proudest or most satisfied when I am accomplishing my goals. For that particular reason, I chose values that fall in line with that.
  </p>
  <p class="par_text">
        Values:<br>
        Accomplishment(5)<br>
        Creativity(3)<br>
        Growth(4)<br>
        Challenge(4)<br>
        Efficiency(5)
  </p>
  <p class="par_text">
        Efficiency is a very important value to me. When I tackle certain tasks, I always look for the most efficient route. I’m the type of person that has to min/max in every video game I play, sometimes I have to research for an hour or two before I begin allocating any stat points. Some people would probably call me a bit OCD, but I always strive to give myself the biggest advantage I can. Efficiency is also a reason that I was originally drawn to programming. A simple computer program can allow people to accomplish tasks in far less time, with far fewer resources than otherwise would have been required without the program. Even though we haven’t spoken much about efficiency in our programs yet, I find myself always questioning if my way of doing it was the most efficient.

      Recently my friend got a job offer from a new firm, but wasn’t sure if he wanted to take it. He reached out to me for my input on the situation. I broke the situation down by trying to figure out exactly what he wanted out of his career. My answer to his question pretty much aligned with the values I listed above. I told him that I couldn’t tell him what he should do personally, but explained how I would look at the dilemma. I told him it sounded like a great opportunity for him to grow and develop his skills. The entire talk basically covered many of the values that I have listed above.
  </p>
  <p class="par_text">
        My values center around accomplishing a difficult task in a creative and efficient manner. I don’t think these would really help mediate any stereotype threat I was feeling though because they are mostly results driven. If I was feeling some sort of stereotype threat going into a big situation, I wouldn’t be able to rely on these values to help me feel better about the situation. That said, if I am ever feeling some sort of stereotype threat that makes me feel like I am not good enough to be in a particular situation, I can think back on all of the successes I have had in life and realize that I have earned everything that I had leading up to that point. I will make sure to try to focus on the positive and realize that I don’t need to focus on living up to any stereotypes.
